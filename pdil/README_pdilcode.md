2/15/22: behavior analysis, "pdilBehaviorAnalysis_V1"
-Rough script generated for analyzing behavior. The first part of the script is just sorting out which files to pull from where for each patient. Fair bit of manual sorting (so may be prone to human error)
-Run with breakpoints when re-orienting to code. Essentially, the last four cells generate some relevant analyses but you need to select what the 'keyinput' is for each cell. This must be done manually for now.
-To Do for behavior: possible do a repeated measure logistic regression
